automatic wifi test
- keep track of history
- send notice when much lower than usual
- can change threshold
- speed over time
- save home speeds (with a test button)

CHECK THAT AUTOJOINING IS SOMETHING THAT ACUTALLY WORKS
and then:
- show list of wifis, select which to auto join
  - auto join the ones that are selected
  - have policy for auto joining new public wifi in the future
    - speed?
    - blacklist

security analysis—what can we even do?
- maybe run wdutil to give diagnostics?
- e.g. sudo wdutil info or sudo wdutil diagnose -q

create a link to keychain for passwords

keyboard shortcuts for copying current network ssid and password

CHECK THAT THIS WOULD ACTUALLY WORK
and then:
- if joining wifi doesnt work, run diagnostic and say things about why it didnt work

consider autofill but probs not that great?
